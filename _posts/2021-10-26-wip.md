Hi there!

You've hit the traditional Work In Progress commit.

Please, come back later, where you'll be able to read some interesting stuff about:

- productivity hacks
- ergonomics as a developer
- various coding stuff (mostly typescript)
- ~~occasionally arch linux (btw...)~~

Until then you can follow me on [@seb_lks](https://twitter.com/seb_lks).

**Updates**

- **14/03/2022** I no longer use Arch. In fact I have embraced Windows 11.
